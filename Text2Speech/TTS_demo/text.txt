ASL stands for American Sign Language. Hundreds of thousands of people within the U.S. alone rely primarily on American Sign Language to communicate as a result of hearing loss, where millions more make up the American hard-of-hearing community. Encouraging people to learn sign language can help bridge the communication gap between hearing people and members of the hard-of-hearing community.
